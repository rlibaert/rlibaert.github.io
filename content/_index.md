title: "I'm Romain, nice to meet you!"
---

I'm a software engineer from Lille, France with a decade of experience building
robust and scalable systems from the ground up. My career spans from low-level
system programming to modern microservices architectures, with a consistent
focus on crafting elegant solutions performing at scale.

Currently serving as a Golang Back-end Engineer, I design and implement APIs
within microservices ecosystems while mentoring development teams. My technical
foundation in C and system-level programming gives me a unique perspective on
performance optimization and architectural decisions.

While some might be satisfied with *practical* solutions, I always strive for
simplicity. I believe it is a defining characteristic of expertise. This
philosophy has consistently delivered systems that are not just functional, but
performant, maintainable and pleasant to work with.
